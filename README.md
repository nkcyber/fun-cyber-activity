# Fun Cyber Activity

> [!WARNING]  
> This is still in the idea stage.

## The situation

Many people can benefit from learning cybersecurity principles. However, many of our club resources are built for students who have a strong technical foundation. These resources may prove to be inaccesible to students who are not already familiar with computers.

In a situation where we are presenting to the 11-13 age range, where students cannot be expected to have deep technical proficiency, it may be hepful to have a resource that illustrates cybersecurity concepts without requiring computers at all.

## The lesson

Computers always do exactly as they are told.

Hackers can look at the instructions, and find ways to manipulate them.

## The activity

> [!CAUTION]
> _Goal_, _input_, and _instructions_ are still poorly defined in this draft.

There are three distinct groups:
  1. **Computer** - executes _instructions_
  2. **Blue Team** - tries to create instructions that accomplish a _goal_
  3. **Red Team** - looks at the _instructions_, and tries to manipulate the _input_ to perform a different _outcome_.

> [!TIP]
> Players may or may not cycle between teams. I don't know what would be better.

### How do we define _goal_, _input_, and _instructions_?

#### Idea 1

It's great to get students moving and active.

This activity starts with two spots on the floor, _begin_ and _end_.

The **computer** starts on _begin_ and looks at a set of _instructions_ (posted on a whiteboard or something) and follows the _instructions_ exactly.

The **blue team** wants the computer to reach the _end_.

The **red team** wants the computer to not reach the _end_.

The _instructions_ consist of:
- go forward
- turn left
- turn right
- if (something in front of you)

> [!CAUTION]
> **What is input supposed to be??** idk. maybe we play on a grid system, and the **red team** has to manipulate what's on the grid. that would require a lot of materials though. it would be nice to figure out some type of input that doesn't need a large variety of prep time. maybe just using sheets of colored paper would work. (e.g. if you're in front of a RED square, do this; attackers move the red square; you're always in a barrier of green squares.)
